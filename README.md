# Appeal Case Automation

## **Overview**
Appeal Case Automation is a project designed to simplify the process of drafting court appeal documents. By leveraging the power of language models and vector databases, this system allows users to input case details and generates professionally formatted legal appeals. The project aims to assist legal professionals, researchers, and individuals with minimal legal expertise in creating accurate and efficient appeals.

## **Features**

- **Automated Document Generation:** Input case details and generate a formatted legal appeal document.
- **Vector Database Integration:** Fetches relevant legal templates and case examples to ensure the appeal is contextually accurate.
- **Customizable Templates:** Allows the use of predefined or user-uploaded templates.
- **PDF Formatting:** Generates a clean, professional PDF with proper formatting (e.g., bold text, line breaks).
- **Error Handling:** Identifies and removes unnecessary metadata or formatting instructions from the input.

## **Installation**

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+
2. Virtual environment setup (optional but recommended)
3. Required Python libraries:
   - `reportlab`
   - `re`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/appeal-case-automation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd appeal-case-automation
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## **Usage**

1. Input case details (e.g., parties involved, issues on appeal, legal arguments).
2. The system retrieves relevant templates and constructs a legal appeal document.
3. Generate a PDF by interpreting formatting instructions (e.g., `\n` for line breaks, `**text**` for bold).
4. Review and download the final PDF.

## **Code Example**

Here is a snippet demonstrating how to process text and generate a PDF:

```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas

raw_text = """IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 11TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR FLORIDA\n\n**HARRY, Appellant**\n\n**v.**\n\n**STATE OF FLORIDA, Appellee**\n"""

def text_to_pdf(text, output_file="appeal_case.pdf"):
    c = canvas.Canvas(output_file, pagesize=letter)
    lines = text.split("\n")
    y = 750
    for line in lines:
        if "**" in line:
            c.setFont("Helvetica-Bold", 12)
            line = line.replace("**", "")
        else:
            c.setFont("Helvetica", 10)
        c.drawString(50, y, line)
        y -= 20
    c.save()

text_to_pdf(raw_text)
```
