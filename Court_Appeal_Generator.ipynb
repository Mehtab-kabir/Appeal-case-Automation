Hamilton  in Cabarrus  County Superior  Court.   Heard in the Court of Appeals  8 \\nOctober 2024 . \\nAttorney General Joshua H. Stein, by Assistant Attorney General Jessica \\nHelms, for the State . \\n \\nJason Christopher Yoder for Defendant -appellant .  \\n \\n \\nWOOD , Judge.  \\n Fernando Rodriquez McCullough (“Defendant”) appeals from a final judgment \\nfollowing the revocation of  his probation .  \\nI. Factual and Procedural Background  \\nOn 18 May 2022, Defendant pleaded guilty to assault by strangulation, assault \\non a female , and injury to real property.  He was sentenced to 11 to 23 months of \\nimprisonment , suspended for 18 months of supervised probation , and  was ordered to \\npay court appointed attorney fees plus  a $75 .00 attorney appointment fee.    STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 2 - On 7 May 2023, Defendant was charged for the criminal offenses of DWI and \\ndiving while license revoked  for an  impaired revocation in Cabarrus County.  On 17 \\nMay 2023, Defendant’s probation officer  filed a violation report in Cabarrus County \\nSuperior Court alleging Defendant had violated the conditions of his probation by \\nfailing to pay court and supervision fees as ordered by the court and for committing \\nthe new criminal offenses of DWI and diving while license revoked for an impaired \\nrevocation .   \\nDefendant’s  probation  expired on 14 November 2023, and his  violation hearing \\nwas held on 16 November 2023 .  The trial court found good cause to retain jurisdiction \\nbecause the hearing was conducted during the same session of court in which \\nDefendant’s probation expired.  Defendant admitted the violations related to owing \\nmoney but denied committing a new criminal offense.   \\nAt the hearing , Defendant’s  probation officer testified she filed a violation \\nreport alleging new criminal offenses after  a magistrate issued a warrant charging \\nDefendant with five offenses: driving while impaired, driving while license revoked \\nfor an impaired revocation, no liability insurance, “giving, lending, or borrowing a \\nlicense plate” and “expired/no inspection.”  Th e State introduced the warrant into \\nevidence as State’s Exhibit 1.  The State also introduce d an officer’s affidavit, consent \\nform, and  intoxilyzer result form from the 7 May 2023 arrest .  Defense counsel \\nobjected to the probation officer testifying to  the content of those items rather than \\nthe arresting officer .  The trial c ourt noted Defendant had the right to confront STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 3 - witnesses at the hearing but overruled the objection concluding that the officer’s \\ntestimony would be extraneous under this Court’s decision in Singletary .  State v. \\nSingletary , 290 N.C. App. 540, 893 S.E.2d 215 (2023).  The probation officer also \\ntestified that Defendant had called her to report his arrest  for the new offenses .   \\nThe trial court found the evidence sufficient to support revocation of \\nDefendant’s probation for committing a new criminal offense based on the officer’s \\naffidavit, the consent form, the test results, and the Defendant’s admission to his \\nprobation officer.  After revoking Defendant’s probation, the trial court ordered the \\nclerk to enter a civil judgment for $325 .00 in attorney  fees, as well as  another  $75.00 \\nattorney appointment fee.   \\nII. Analysis  \\nDefendant argues the trial court erred in finding Defendant had committed a \\nnew criminal offense based on the magistrate’s warrant and violated Defendant’s due \\nprocess and statutory right to confrontation by failing to make a finding of good cause \\nfor denying his right to confront and cross -examine the arresting officer.  \\nAdditionally , Defendant argues the trial court erred in ordering Defendant to pay a \\nsecond $75 .00 appointment of counsel fee and erred in finding that “[e]ach violation \\nis, in and of itsel f a sufficient basis upon which this Court should revoke probation \\nand activ ate the suspended sentence.”  \\nA. Jurisdiction  \\nOn 16 November 2023, after the trial court  revok ed Defendant’s p robation , STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 4 - Defendant gave oral notice of appeal  in open court .  Because  it is a final judgment \\nfrom the superior court , jurisdiction lies in this Court , pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § \\n7A-27(b) (2023).  \\nThe North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure permit  appeals from a \\ncriminal action to be made in two ways : entering  oral notice at trial or filing written \\nnotice with the clerk of superior court within fourteen days.  N.C. R. App. P. 4 (a).  \\nThis Court has held attorney fees are civil penalties subject to the rules of civil \\nprocedure  governing appeals.   State v. Smith , 188 N.C. App. 842, 845, 656 S.E.2d 695, \\n697 (2008).  Therefore, defendants are required to follow the civil rules of  procedure  \\nwhen app ealing attorney fees .  A party must file and serve written notice of appeal \\nwith the clerk of superior court within thirty days  after entry of judgment .  N.C. R. \\nApp. P. 3 (a),(c)(1).   Defendant gave oral notice of appeal after entry  of the judgment  \\nbut failed to enter written notice of appeal with in the time proscribed.    \\nOn 25 June 2024 , Defendant filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari pursuant to  \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A -32(c), Rule 21 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate \\nProcedure, and State v. Ledbetter , 371 N.C. 192, 194 , 814 S.E.2d 39, 41  (2018) \\nrequesting this Court cure the defective notice of appeal.  Under Appellate Rule \\n21(a)(1), this Court may issue a writ of certiorari to permit review “when the right to \\nprosecute an appeal has been lost by the failure to take timely action[.]”  N.C. R.  App. \\nP. 21(a)(1)(2023).   Our Supreme Court has stated the writ of certiorari should issue \\nupon “a reasonable show of merits and that the ends of justice will be thereby STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 5 - promoted.” King v. Taylor , 188 N.C. 450, 451 , 124 S.E. 751, 751  (1924).  \\n The State  concedes the trial court erred  by duplicating the attorney \\nappointment fee.  Under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A -455, a trial court may impose attorney’s \\nfees against a convicted, indigent defendant for the cost incurred by a defendant’s \\nappointed counsel.  State v. Webb , 358 N.C. 92, 100, 591 S.E.2d 505, 512 (2004) .  The \\nstatute permits  a $75 .00 fee for the appointment of a court -appointed attorney in \\nevery criminal case .  The  fee applie s once,  “regardless of the number of cases which \\nthe attorney was as signed .  An additional appointment  fee shall not be assessed i f \\nthe charges for which an attorney was appointed were reassigned to a different \\nattorney .”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A -455.1(e)  (2023).  \\n As this issue clearly has merit,  we grant  certiorari to reach the merits of \\nDefendant’s appeal.   \\nB. Standard of Review  \\nA trial court’s decision to revoke probation is reviewed for “manifest abuse of \\ndiscretion.” Singletary  at 545, 893 S.E.2d at 220.   \\nA hearing to revoke a defendant’s probationary sentence \\nonly requires that the evidence be such as to reasonably \\nsatisfy the judge in the exercise of his sound discretion that \\nthe defendant has willfully violated a valid condition of \\nprobation or that the defendant has violated without lawful \\nexcuse a valid condition upon which the sentence was \\nsuspended.  The judge’s finding of such a violation, if \\nsupported by competent evidence, will not be overturned \\nabsent a showing of manifest abuse of discretion.  \\n \\nState v. Young , 190 N.C. App. 458, 459, 660 S.E.2d 574, 576 (2008) (citation STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 6 - and quotation marks omitted).  “Abuse of discretion results where the court ’s ruling \\nis manifestly unsupported by reason or is so arbitrary that it could not have been the \\nresult of a reasoned decision.” State v. Hennis , 323 N.C. 279, 285, 372 S.E.2d 523, 527 \\n(1988).   \\nWhen the trial court’s revocation of probation relies on statutory \\ninterpretation, it is a  question of law and is reviewed de novo .  State v. Krider , 258 \\nN.C. App. 111,  113, 810 S.E.2d 828,  829 (2018),  aff'd but criticized, 371 N.C. 466, 818 \\nS.E.2d 102 (2018 ).  Claims alleging violations of statutory guidelines and \\nconstitutional rights are also reviewed de novo.   State v. Graham , 200 N.C. App. 204, \\n214, 683 S.E.2d 437, 444 (2009).  “Under a de novo  review , the court considers the \\nmatter anew and freely sub stitutes its own judgment  for that of the lower tribunal .”  \\nState v. Williams , 362 N.C. 628, 632 –33, 669 S.E.2d 290, 294 (2008) ( citation omitted ). \\nC. New Criminal Offense  \\nThe trial court may revoke probation when a defendant commits a  criminal \\noffense while on probation.  N.C. Gen Stat. §§ 15A -1343(b)(1) (2022), 15A -1344(a) \\n(2022).  That a defendant is charged with a criminal offense is “insufficient to support \\na finding that he committed them.” Singletary  at 54 6, 893 S.E.2d at 220 (quoting \\nState v. Hancock , 248 N.C. App. 744, 749, 789 S.E.2d 522, 526 (2016)).  To revoke \\nprobation for committing a criminal offense, there must be “some form of evidence \\nthat a crime was commit ted.”  State v. Graham , 282 N.C. App. 158, 160, 869 S.E.2d \\n776, 778 (2022).  However, “the alleged violation of a valid condition of probation need STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 7 - not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Id at 159 , 869 S.E.2d at 778 .  The trial \\ncourt only need find that a defendant “willfully violated a valid condition of probation” \\nto revoke probation.  Singletary  at 545,893 S.E.2d at 220 (quoting State v. Young , 190 \\nN.C. App. 458, 459, 660 S.E.2d 574, 576 (2008)).  The evidence must  “reasonably \\nsatisfy the judge in  the exercise of  his sound discretion that the defendant has \\nwillfully violated a valid condition of probation  . . . .”  Id.  The evidence is sufficient  \\nwhen  “the trial court can independently find that the defendant committed a new \\noffense.” Id. at 546, 893 S.E.2d at 221 (quoting Hancock , 248 N.C. App. at 7 49, 789 \\nS.E.2d at 526).   \\nAt the hearing, t he trial court cited Singletary  to support its decision .  In \\nSingletary , the trial court  relied upon the violation report , arrest warrants, the \\ndefendant’s  admission to her probation officer of the crimes, and images of the \\ndefendant committing the alleged crimes to make an independent determination that \\nit was “more probable than not Defendant committed the new criminal offense.” Id. \\nat 547, 893 S.E.2d at 221.  \\nDefendant conte nds the trial court erred in its comparison to Singletary  as \\nthere was no independent evidence to establish that he committed a new crime.  We \\ndisagree.   \\nThe trial court was presented  with the driving while impaired  arrest warrant  \\ncontaining  Defendant’s photograph , the charging officer’s affidavit , the intoxilyzer \\nreport showing a blood alcohol level of 0.12, and the probation officer’s testimony STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 8 - regarding the telephone conversation she had with Defendant shortly after the \\nincident.  Although the arrest warrant is not sufficient to allow the trial court to \\nindependently determine Defendant probably committed a new offense,  the charging \\nofficer’s affidavit and the intoxilyzer report were sufficient to allow the trial court to \\nindependently determine Defendant probably had committed the offenses of driving \\nwhile impaired.  Thus, the evidence allowed the trial court to independently  \\ndetermin e that i t was “more probable than not Defendant committed the new \\ncriminal offense ” and thereby violated  the terms of  his probation.   Id.   \\nD. Due Process and Right to Confrontation  \\nA probation revocation hearing is not a criminal proceeding and therefore the \\n“Sixth Amendment right to confrontation in a probation  revocation  hearing does not \\nexist.” Singletary  at 548, 893 S.E.2d at 222 (quoting State v. Hemingway , 278 N.C. \\nApp. 538, 548, 863 S.E.2d 279, 286 (2021)).  N.C. Gen Stat. § 15A -1345(e) “controls \\nthe probationer’s right to confrontation” during a  hearing.  Id. There fore, no  \\nconstitutional argument  exists ; there is only a statutory argument for Defendant’s \\nviolation of due process.  Id. \\nUnder N.C. Gen Stat. § 15A -1345(e), during a revocation hearing, the \\nprobationer “may confront and cross -examine adverse witnesses unless the court \\nfinds good cause for not allowing confrontation.” N.C. Gen Stat. § 15A -1345(e) (2022).  \\nThe court may use its discretion to determine if good cause exists for denying \\nconfrontation.  Singletary , 290 N.C. App. at 548, 893 S.E.2d at 222 (citing State v.  STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 9 - Jones , 269 N.C. App. 440, 444, 838 S.E.2d at 686, 689 (2020 )).  Accordingly, the issue \\nis whether the trial court made a prejudicial error by not making a finding of good \\ncause  for denying Defendant the ability to confront the arresting officer.  \\nWhile enumerating its findings  in open court,  the trial court cited Singletary \\nexplaining “failure to require an adverse witness to testify is not error if the adverse \\nwitness ’ testimony would have been merely extraneous evidence in light of other \\ncompetent evidence presented  . . . .”  Singletary  at 548, 893 S.E.2d at 222.    \\nIn Singletary , this Court found that when the trial court had arrest warrants, \\nvideo footage, and the parole officer’s  testimony about the defendant’s admissions, \\nthere was sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that the defendant \\nhad committed new crimes without any testimony from the witness at issue.  Id. at \\n549, 893 S.E.2d at 223.   \\nAs in Singletary , here, the trial court received  into evidence  documents filed \\nwith the court , specifically  the arrest warrant containing  Defendant’s picture and  the \\nintox ilyzer results indicating  a breath alcohol level above the legal limit.  In addition, \\nDefendant’s probation  officer testified that Defendant contacted her about his arrest \\nand admitted he had been driving.  Even without the arresting officer’s affidavit or \\ntestimony , the trial court had sufficient evidence to independently determine a new \\noffense of driving while impaired had been committed.  Because  the arresting officer’s \\ntestimony would have been merely extraneous when sufficient evidence had been \\nadmitted , the trial court did not err by omitting a finding of good cause for denying STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 10 - the confrontation of the arresting officer.  \\nE. Clerical Errors . \\nDefendant’s probation officer filed a violation report  alleging  Defendant  was in \\nviolation of h is probation for  failing to pay court and supervision fees  and committ ing \\nnew criminal offenses.  When completing the Judgment and Commitment Upon \\nRevocation of Probation  form , the trial court checked  both box four, indicating “each \\nviolation is, in and of itself, a sufficient basis upon which this Court should revoke \\nprobation and activate the suspended sentence ,” as well as  box five (a)  which \\nacknowledged Defendant’s probation could only be revoked “for the willful violation \\nof the condition(s) that he/she not commit any criminal offense  . . . .”  Probation can \\nonly be revoked if the probationer:  \\n(1) commits a new criminal offense in violation of N.C. Gen. \\nStat. § 15A -1343(b)(1); (2) absconds supervision in \\nviolation of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 15A -1343(b)(3a); or (3) \\nviolates any condition of probation after serving two prior \\nperiods of CRV [confinement in  response to violations] \\nunder N.C. Gen. Stat. § 15A -1344(d2).  \\n \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 15A –1344(a) (2023) ; State v. Krider , 258 N.C. App.111, 113, affirmed \\nin part, 371 N.C. 466 (2018).  Thus, Defendant’s  failure to pay the fees alleged in the \\nviolation report is not a sufficient basis for revoking probation  and the trial court’s \\nselection of box four indicating that each violation was a sufficient basis upon which \\nthe court could revoke probation was error.  \\n Thorough review of the trial court’s  findings made in open court clearly STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 11 - indicate Defendant’s probation  was revoked on the basis of new criminal conduct.  \\nThe trial court stated,   \\nThe State has presented sufficient evidence to indicate that \\nthe defendant has committed new criminal conduct while \\nhe was on probation.  That is [a] revocable offense.  The \\nrecommendation from the probation officer is that his \\nprobation be revoked.  I am going to accept the \\nrecommendation.  I'm going to revoke his probation  . . . .   \\n \\nNotwithstanding the trial court’s statements, the trial court checked the wrong box.  \\n“When the trial court incorrectly checks a box on a judgment form that contradicts \\nits findings and the mistake is supported by the evidence in the record, we may \\nremand for correction of this clerical error in the judgment.”  State v. Newsome , 264 \\nN.C. App. 659, 66 5, 828 S.E.2d 495, 500 (2019).  Accordingly, we remand to the trial \\ncourt for correction of the clerical error.    \\nF. Appointment Fee for Court -Appointed Attorney  \\nDefendant next argues the trial court incorrectly assessed two appointment \\nfees for his court -appointed attorney, and t he State  concedes the error .  Pursuant to \\nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A -455.1, a trial court may impose attorney’s fees against a \\nconvicted, indigent defendant for the cost incurred by a defendant’s appointed \\ncounsel.  Webb  at 100, 591 S.E.2d at 512.  The statute allows for a $75 .00 appointment \\nfee for court -appointed attorney  fees in every criminal case provided  the fee shall  be \\napplied “only once, regardless of the number of cases to which the attorney was \\nassigned.  An additional appointment fee shall not be assessed if the charges for STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 12 - which an attorney was appointed were reassigned to a different attorney.”  N.C. Gen. \\nStat. § 7A -455.1(e)  (2023) .  The plain reading of this statute shows the attorney \\nappointment fee should only be charged once for each case  and our Supreme Court \\nhas stated that “[c]osts are imposed only at sentencing  . . . . ”  State v. Webb  at 101, \\n591 S.E.2d at 513.  However, here it was charged both during sentencing after \\nDefendant pleaded guilty  and at the probation revocation hearing.  \\nFurther, the attorney appointment fee statute specifically states it can only be \\nassessed if the “person is convicted.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A -455.1(a)  (2023) .  Here, \\nDefendant  had already been assessed  a $75 .00 fee during sentencing when  he pleaded \\nguilty in this case.  Probation violation proceedings occur in the same case  for which \\na defendant is placed on probation following a conviction but are not in themselves \\nnew convictions.    Our Supreme Court has clarified, “[w] hen a defendant's probation \\nis revoked, the sentence the defendant may be required to serve is the punishment \\nfor the crime of which he had previously  been found guilty. ”  State v. Murchison, 367 \\nN.C. 461, 463, 758 S.E.2d 356, 358 (2014) (cleaned up)  (emphasis added).     \\nTherefore, the second $75.00 appointment fee charged after Defendant’s \\nprobation revocation must be removed from the calculation of civil penalties charged \\nto Defendant .  We vacate the duplicate attorney fee and remand to correct the \\njudgment amount.  \\nIII. Conclusion  \\nFor the foregoing reasons , the trial court did not err in its determination  STATE V . MCCULLOUGH  \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 13 - Defendant had committed a new criminal offense  warranting,  in its discretion , \\nrevocation of Defendant’s probation , nor did the trial court err in denying Defendant’s \\nconfrontation of the arresting officer.   However,  the trial court erred  when it charged \\nDefendant the  $75.00  attorney appointment  fee twice .

Plaintiff s contend the trial court erred by finding that a statute of \\nlimitations barred their only remedy for the violation of their rights.  \\nI. Factual and Procedural Background  CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 2 - Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges the following: Cedarbrook is an adult care home \\nin Nebo, North Carolina that provides a place of residence for disabled adults with \\nmental illness who are stable in their recovery.  Cedarbrook has been licensed to serve \\nthis population since 2002.  DHHS is the state administrative agency that oversees \\nhealth and human related services in North Carolina.  The Division of Health \\nServices Regulation (“DHRS”) is the division of DHHS that provides regulatory \\noversight for healthcare  and adult care facilities.  The Adult Care Licensure Section \\n(“ACLS”)  within  DHRS oversees adult care facilities.  \\nThe complaint further alleges: ACLS conduct s annual inspections of the \\nCedarbrook facility.  In addition, the McDowell County Department of Social Services \\n(“DSS”) over sees Cedarbrook and makes site visits  multiple times per month.  From \\nits founding in 2002 through 2015 Cedarbrook consistently received excellent scores \\nfrom both agencies and had strong working relationships with each agency.   Prior to \\nNovember 2015, Cedarbrook had never been cited for regulatory violations by either \\nagency.  \\nOn 6 November 2015, the United States Department of Justice (“USDOJ”) \\nissued an enforcement letter to the State of North Carolina.  North Carolina \\npreviously had been cited for failure to provide mentally ill adults with independent \\nhousing options , and the USDOJ demand ed the State take corrective action .  Three \\ndays after the USDOJ issued its enforcement letter , the ACLS began its annual \\ninspection of Cedarbrook.    CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 3 - Plaintiffs’ allege t he 2015 inspection differed dramatically from the prior  \\nthirteen evaluations.  For instance, p ractices that had been in place for years at \\nCedarbrook and were previously praised by ACLS were  assessed as  severe violations.  \\nAdditionally , ACLS alleged violations that had  no basis in the governing \\nadministrative rules or statutes.    \\nOn 19 November 2015, ACLS issued a summary Suspension of Admissions \\nagainst Cedarbrook prevent ing Cedarbrook from admitting new residents .  On 17 \\nDecember 2015 , ACLS issued a Notice of Intent to Revoke Cedarbrook’s license to \\noperate  but withdr ew it on 16 May 2016.  Notwithstanding  ACLS’ withdrawal of the \\nNotice of Intent, Plaintiffs allege the Suspension of Admission caused a fifty percent  \\n(50%) reduc tion in the number of residents at Cedarbrook in six months.     \\nPlaintiffs  filed Cedarbrook I  in 2016 with the Office of Administrative Hearings \\n(“OAH”).  The OAH issued a stay on 6 July 2016, enjoining the suspension  of \\nadmission against Cedarbrook.  ACLS took more than a month to lift  the suspension , \\nwaiting until  12 August 2016  to do so .  While the suspension was enjoined, ACLS \\nissued penalties in excess of $340,000 .00 to Cedarbrook .  On the morning of trial at \\nthe OAH, ACLS agreed to withdraw all agency actions taken against Cedarbrook and \\nreissue their Four -Star rating.  However , Plaintiffs’ assert the suspension had caused \\nthe sale of Cedarbrook to fall through and the appraised value to decrease to the point  \\nthat Cedarbrook could no longer be sold at the previously secured purchase price.  \\nACLS’ actions allegedly cost the facility over $500,000 .00 in lost revenue, increased CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 4 - operating expenses and  added attorney’s fees , as well as costing $790,000 .00 in \\nproceeds from the lost sale.   \\nOn 25 October 2018  Plaintiffs filed  Cedarbrook II  with the Industrial \\nCommission claiming DHHS engaged in negligent regulation under the State Tort \\nClaims Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143 -291 et seq. (“STCA”).  DHHS moved to dismiss the \\nclaim on the basis of sovereign immunity.  On 13 March 2019, a  Deputy \\nCommissioner denied the motion and  on 6 November 2020  the Industrial Commission \\naffirmed  the Commissioner’s denial of the Motion to Dismiss  allowing the suit to \\ncontinue.    \\nOn  4 December 2020 , DHHS filed notice of appeal to th is Court.  In an opinion \\nissued on  21 December 2021 , this Court affirmed the  decision of the Full Industrial \\nCommission.  Cedarbrook Residential C tr, Inc. v. N.C . Dep’t of Health and Hum. \\nServs. , 281 N.C. App. 9, 868 S.E.2d 623 (2021).  Based on the dissent in the opinion,  \\nDHHS appealed  to the Supreme Court of North Carolina.  On 16 December 2022 , the \\nSupreme Court reversed  this Court finding that sovereign immunity applied and  \\nholding  that “the theory t hat the agency regulated the entity in question in a \\nnegligent manner ” is “not generally the type of decisions for which the State is liable \\nto private citizens in tort.”   Cedarbrook Residential C tr, Inc. v. N.C Dep’t of Health \\nand Hum. Servs. , 383 N.C. 31 , 47, 50, 881 S.E.2d 558, 571, 573 (2022) .  The Supreme \\nCourt further  state d that under the State Tort Claims Act, the State is only liable for \\nnegligence in instances where a “private person would be liable under the laws of CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 5 - North Carolina” and private persons do not exercise regulatory power and cannot be \\nheld liable for negligent regulation so neither can the State.  Id. at 50, 881 S.E.2d at \\n573.  On 1 January 2023 Plaintiffs  petitioned the Supreme Court to rehear the case , \\nbut on 13 February 2023 the Supreme Court denied the petition.   \\nBecause the Supreme Court ’s decision  removed the STCA as a remedy to \\nnegligent regulatory actions , Plaintiff s turned to assert constitutional claims that had \\nbeen previously unavailable under the confines of North Carolina’s  STCA.  On 30 \\nMarch 2023 , Plaintiff s filed the present complaint in McDowell County Superior \\nCourt.   \\nOn 15 June 2023 , DHHS moved to dismiss the complaint arguing that the \\nclaims  asserted  are barred by the statute of limitations , the prohibition on claim \\nsplitting , and res judicata .  The matter came on for hearing before Judge J. Thomas \\nDavis on 25 September 2023.  On 4 October 2023 the trial court granted DHHS’ \\nmotion and entered the Dismissal Order.  Plaintiff s timely appealed .   \\nII. Analysis  \\nPlaintiff s assert the trial court erred by granting DHHS’ Rule 12(b)(6) Motion \\nto Dismiss.   We review de novo  an order granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  \\nBridges v. Parrish , 366 N.C. 539, 541, 742 S.E.2d 794 , 796  (2013).   “In other words, \\nunder de novo review, the appellate court as the reviewing court considers the Rule \\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss anew: It freely substitutes its own assessment of whether \\nthe allegations of the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for th e trial court ’s CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 6 - assessment. ”  Taylor v. Bank of Am ., N.A. , 382 N.C. 677, 679, 878 S.E.2d 798, 800 \\n(2022).  The court must address “whether the allegations of the complaint, if treated \\nas true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under some \\nlegal theory.” Id. at 679, 878 S.E.2d at 800 (citing Bridges  at 541, 742 S.E.2d at 796). \\nPlaintiffs  bring forth  three separate claims under the North Carolina \\nConstitution : (1) DHHS violated the Plaintiffs’ right to the fruits of their own labor,  \\n(2) DHHS interfered with their business which was a regulatory taking under law of \\nthe land, and (3) DHHS deprived Plaintiff s of their due process rights.   \\nDefendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss  allege d the claims should be \\ndismissed because the claim s violate the statute of limitations  and are barred by \\nclaim splitting or res judicata .   \\nIn its ruling , the trial  court stated:  \\nGreat arguments, fascinating issue, but it ’s unfortunately \\ngoing to be left to three guys in Raleigh to finalize this \\nthing or settle it.  I ’m going to allow your motion to dismiss \\nbased on the statute of limitations on a constitutional \\nclaim. . . . [I]t started to run and it ’s run and I think the \\ncase law is not  that it had to do with the Industrial \\nCommission case.   It’s just stating what the law  is.  It’s not \\nany kind o f modification or change that would have \\naffected their  equitable or legal rights in r egard to the \\nstatute – or obligations in regard to the statute of \\nlimitations .   \\n \\n \\nA. Statute of Limitations  \\nPlaintiffs and Defendant agree that the statute of limitations for both CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 7 - constitutional and negligence claims i s three years.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1 -52 (2023) ; \\nMcFadyen v. New Hanover Cnty ., 273 N.C. App. 124, 131, 848 S.E.2d 217, 222 (2020).   \\nHowever, Plaintiffs contend that the statute of limitations did not accrue until the \\nSupreme Court issued its decision in Cedarbrook II.  We agree.  \\nChapter 1 of the North Carolina Statutes which sets the statute of limitations \\nin N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1 -52 clearly  states “[c]ivil actions can only be commenced within \\nthe periods prescribed in this Chapter, after the cause of action has accrued .”  N.C. \\nGen. Stat. §1 -15(a)  (2023) (emphasis added) .  Therefore, the statute of limitations \\nbegins to run when the cause of action accrues.   \\nIn no event can a statute of limitations begin to run until \\nplaintiff is entitled to institute action.   The cause of action \\ndoes not accrue until the injured party is at liberty to sue.   \\nThe statute of limitations begins to run only when a party \\nbecomes liable to an action.  \\n \\nRaftery v. Wm. C. Vick Const. Co. , 291 N.C. 180, 183, 230 S.E.2d 405, 407  (1976).  \\n Here , Plaintiff s were not entitled to institute an action for constitutional claims \\nuntil the North Carolina Supreme Court determined  in Cedarbrook II  that the State \\nTort Claims Act  (“STCA ”) was not  an adequate – and therefore the exclusive – remedy \\nfor the negligent regulatory actions of the DHHS.   Cedarbrook Residential Ctr., Inc. \\nv. N.C. Dep’t. Health and Hum. Servs. , 383 N.C. 31, 881 S.E.2d 558 (2022).   \\nNorth Carolina law is clear that a litigant who has a remedy under state law \\ncannot bring a constitutional or “ Corum” claim to redress the same injury and seek \\nthe same remedy.  Washington v. Cline , 385 N.C. 824, 826, 898 S.E.2 667, 669 (2024); CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 8 - Corum v. Univ . of N.C., 330 N.C. 761, 782, 413 S.E.2d 276, 289 (1992).  Under state \\nlaw, the purpose of the STCA was to “give greater access to the courts to plaintiffs in \\ncases in which they [are] injured by the State's negligence.” Ray v. N.C. Dep't of \\nTransp. , 366 N.C. 1, 11, 727 S.E.2d 675, 683 (2012).   Specifically, the North Carolina \\nIndustrial Commission was charged with “hearing and passing upon [such] tort \\nclaims against ... agencies of the State.” N.C.  Gen. Stat. § 143 -291(a)  (2023) .   \\nPrior to Cedarbrook II multiple cases from both the Supreme Court and Court \\nof Appeals recognized that claims to recover for state agencies’ negligent acts  were \\nwithin the sco pe of the STCA .  See Multiple Claimants v. N.C.  Dep’t. of Health and \\nHum . Servs., 361 N.C. 372, 646 S.E.2d 356 (2007)  (allowing STCA claims for \\nnegligence in inspecting jails), Ray v. N.C.  Dep’t. of Transp. , 366 N.C. 1, 727 S.E.2d \\n675 (2012)  (negligent narrowing of a roadway as an STCA claim),  Russell  v. N.C. \\nDep’t. of Env ’t and Nat . Res., 227 N.C. App. 306, 742 S.E.2d 329 (2013) (STCA claims \\nfor negligence, negligent misrepresentation and gross negligence),  Patrick v. N.C. \\nDep’t. of Health and Hum . Servs ., 192 N.C. App. 713, 6 66 S.E.2d 171 (2008) (STCA \\nclaim against DHHS for negligence in investigating reports of abuse) , Batts v. N.C. \\nDep’t. of Transp. , 160 N.C. App. 554, 586 S.E.2d 550 (2003) (allowing automobile \\npassengers to assert negligence claim against NCDOT).   Most significantly , in \\nNanny’s Korner  when addressing a plaintiff’s  constitutional claim against DHHS, \\nthis Court concluded that the constitutional claim failed because the plaintiff  “had an \\nadequate state remedy in the form of the Industrial Commission through the Torts CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 9 - Claim Act.”   Nanny’s Korner Day Care Ctr., v. N .C. Dep’t. of Health and Hum. Servs. , \\n264 N.C. App. 71, 80, 825 S.E.2d 34, 41 (2019) (rev.) .   \\n Defendant  argues  that Plaintiffs cannot rely on Nanny’s Korner  as an example \\nof the existing state law at the time because it was not issued until after Cedarbrook \\nII was filed ; however , the decision  was based on the Court’s understanding of North \\nCarolina statute at that time which  established that STCA claims bar constitutional \\nclaims on the same issue.   See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143.291(a)(201 7).  Notwithstanding \\ntheir current argument, DHHS  argu ed in Nanny’s Korner  that the constitutional \\nclaims in that c ase must  be dismissed because the STCA provided a “ sole and \\nadequate  remedy ” for negligence claims against a state agency.  Nanny’s Korner Day \\nCare Ctr., v. N .C. Dep’t of Health and Hum. Servs. , 264 N.C. App. 71, 80, 825 S.E.2d \\n34, 41 (2019) (rev.)  (appellate  brief , 2018 WL 4869951 ) (citing N.C. Gen.

App. 430, 437, 528 S.E.2d, 911, 915 \\n(2000) ).   \\nAlthough the Supreme Court’s decision in Cedarbrook II  does not purport to \\noverrule  the previous law, they do state “we do not fault the Court of Appeals for \\nrelying upon Nanny’s Korner  as binding precedent ,” and the  Court  specifies that they   \\n“overrule [Nanny’s Korner ] to the extent it conflicts with this opinion.”   Cedarbrook \\nResidential Ctr., Inc. v. N .C. Dep’t. of Health and Hum. Servs. , 383 N.C. 31, 57, 881 \\nS.E.2d 558, 577 (2022).   CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 10 -  Not until  our Supreme Court’s decision in Cedarbrook II  differentiated \\nbetween the general negligence claims that are permissible under the STCA and \\n“negligent regulation” claims  which the Court viewed as discretionary decisions for \\nwhich the State is not liable in tort  negligence did Plaintiffs ’ constitutional claims \\naccrue .  Cedarbrook Residential Center, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health and Hum. Servs. , \\n383 N.C. 31, 50, 881 S.E.2d 558, 573 (2022).   \\nOnce the  Supreme Court removed the opportunity for the Plaintiff s to have their \\nclaims heard under the STCA , Plaintiff s were free to bring a constitutional “ Corum” \\nclaim .  If the “ cause of action does not accrue until the injured party is at liberty to \\nsue,” then the cause of action here did not accrue until 16 December 2022 , the date \\nCedarbrook II was decided.   Raftery v. Wm. C. Vick Const. Co. , 291 N.C. 180, 183, \\n230 S.E.2d 405, 407 (1976).  \\n As discussed supra, our  Supreme Court denied Plaintiff s’ petition for a \\nrehearing of Cedarbrook II on 13 February 2023.  The Plaintiffs followed with the ir \\nCorum claims on 30 March 2023 only six weeks after the final denial and less than \\nfour months after the decision.  Indisputably , Plaintiffs  wasted no time in filing their  \\ncomplaint once the cause of action accrued .  \\nB. Res Judicata  and Claim Splitting  \\nUnder the doctrine of res judicata or ‘claim preclusion,’ a \\nfinal judgment on the merits in one action precludes a \\nsecond suit based on the same cause of action between the \\nsame parties or their privies.   Further, [t]he doctrine \\nprevents the relitigation of all matters  . . . that were or CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 11 - should have been adjudicated in the prior action.   \\n \\nIntersal, Inc. v. Hamilton , 373 N.C. 89, 107, 834 S.E.2d 404, 417 (2019) (internal \\ncitations and quotations omitted).   Although  Defendant claimed in their original \\nMotion to Dismiss in Superior Court that “Cedarbrook’s new complaint alleges \\nprecisely the same facts and seeks the same damages they sought in 2018,” in both \\ntheir written brief and oral argument before this Court, Defendant  stated they were \\nnot raising res judicata  and further noted to this Court that the court below did not \\nrely on that theory for its decision.   \\n Defendant did assert the issue of the prohibition on claim splitting  to the court \\nbelow and to this Court .  Claim splitting is a  common law rule  which prohibits \\nplaintiffs from splitting claims based on  “the principle that all damages incurred as \\nthe result of a single wrong must be recovered in one lawsuit. ”  Reese v. Brooklyn \\nVillage, LLC,  209 N.C. App. 636, 648, 707 S.E.2d 249, 257 (2011).   \\nNeither the claim of res judicata nor claim splitting  holds merit because \\nPlaintiffs ’ claims could not have been brought together.  When the exclusive \\njurisdiction of a forum precludes a claim from being brought the plaintiff cannot be \\nbarred from bringing it elsewhere based on res judicata or claim splitting concerns.  \\nState ex rel. Pilard v. Berninger , 154 N.C. App. 45, 5 4-55, 571 S.E.2d 836, 8 42-43 \\n(2002).  \\nIn the case sub judice , the Industrial Commission was the only competent \\njurisdiction in which Plaintiff s could bring the STCA claim.   However, Plaintiffs were CEDARBROOK RESIDENTIAL CTR., INC. V. N.C.  DEP’T OF HEALTH & HUM. SERVS . \\nOpinion of the Court  \\n \\n- 12 - simultaneously  barred  from bringing  direct constitutional claims  to the Industrial \\nCommission  under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A -245(a)(4)  because it does not have jurisdiction \\nto hear such claims .  “[T]he superior court division has original subject matter \\njurisdiction over constitutional claims[.]”  Gilbert v. N.C. State Bar , 363 N.C. 70, 86, \\n678 S.E.2d 602, 612 (2009).  \\nSince the two claims – one tort, the other constitutional  – could not have been  \\nbrought in the same jurisdiction , Defendant’s assertion that Plaintiffs’ claims  were  \\nidentical  or a single wrong to be brough t at one time necessarily fails.   \\nIII. Conclusion  \\nBecause Plaintiffs  were not entitled to institute an action for constitutional \\nclaims until the North Carolina Supreme Court ’s decision  determined  in Cedarbrook \\nII the State Tort Claims Act was not an adequate – and therefore exclusive – remedy \\nfor the negligent regulatory actions of the DHHS , the cause of action did not accrue \\nuntil the  Court’s ruling .  Therefore, Plaintiffs were  within the statute of limitations \\nwhen the y filed claims mere months after the Cedarbrook II decision.  \\nAdditionally,  Plaintiffs are not barred from bringing the claim based on res \\njudicata or claim splitting  since  the exclusive jurisdiction of the forum precluded both \\nclaims from being brought together.  \\nREVERSE D AND REMAND ED. \\nJudge s COLLINS  and HAMPSON concur . \",\n","   ' \\n DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA  \\nSECOND  DISTRICT  \\n \\n \\nAIDA L.

Baseman of Felix, Felix & Baseman, Tampa , for Appellee.  \\n \\nNORTHCUTT, Judge.  \\nAida L. Cancel  appeals the judgment dissolving her  marriage to \\nMichael A. Cancel.  Among the several issues she has raised, we find \\nharmful error in the circuit court \\'s refusal  to distribute the marital \\nportion of Mr. Cancel \\'s pension . \\nThe parties  worked as federal employees  for many years  during the \\nmarriage  and both earned pensions.  In 2019, they agreed that Ms. \\nCancel would retir e, and  she began  collecting monthly pension benefits .  2 \\n Mr. Cancel  continued working , and he was still employed when the final \\njudgment dissolved the parties \\' marriage .  Thus , his pension was still \\naccruing and not yet in pay status.   It was indisputably much greater in \\nvalue than his wife \\'s.   \\nIn Diffenderfer v. Diffenderfer , 491 So. 2d 265 , 270  (Fla. 1986) , the \\nsupreme court recognized that courts may treat the marital interest in a \\nretirement account either as property to be equitably distributed or as a \\nsource of income  for support purposes .  Given that  Ms. Cancel \\'s pension \\nwas in pay status, t he circuit court appropriately treated it as a monthly \\nincome  source when determining the amount of her perman ent periodic \\nalimony award.  Regarding Mr. Cancel \\'s pension, the court ventured  that \\nit could not distribute the marital portion of the asset  because Mr. \\nCancel  was not yet collectin g it and because the  parties had presented no \\nevidence of its present value .  The court explained its reasoning as \\nfollows:  \\nThe Wife requested a portion of this pension and that request \\nis not feasible given the uncertainty of when the Husband \\nshould choose to retire and what the benefit would be.  The \\nParties both chose to proceed without providing any current \\nvaluations of their respective pensions and so in effect \\nstipulated [that]  the Court could not set a current value on \\nthe pensions.  \\nThus, the court opined that Mr. Cancel \\'s pension must be \"moving \\nforward as a means of income to the Husband when he chooses to retire \\nthat he will be in a better financial situation [than]  the wife. \"   \\nThe circuit court \\'s suggestion that it could not distribute Mr. \\nCancel \\'s future pension benefits without evidence of their present value \\nwas incorrect .  As we will explain,  the court overlooked at least one \\nmethod  it could have employed  to account for the asset in its financial \\naward  without receiving such evidence .  This failure to appreciate the 3 \\n scope of the remedies available to it compels us to reverse .  See Hartford \\nAcc. & Indem. Co. v. Bosworth , 382 So. 2d 1345, 1346 –47 (Fla. 5th DCA \\n1980)  (reversing and remanding for further consideration when the trial \\ncourt appear ed to have misapprehended the extent of its discretion  when \\ndeciding the amount of an award  based on the evidence presented ). \\nThe Diffenderfer  court observed that \"[i]n most cases . . . it may be \\npreferable to deal with pension rights as a marital asset  rather than \" as a \\nfuture income stream.   491 So. 2d at 268.  Florida courts have since \\ndeveloped two principal methods of equitably distributing a future  \\npension benefit as an asset.  The first is to order an \"immediate offset ,\" in \\nwhich the court distributes the portion of the pension \\'s present value \\nthat was earned during the marriage.  Trant v. Trant , 545 So. 2d 428, \\n429 (Fla. 2d DCA 1989) .  This marital interest is calculated by \\nmultiply ing the present value of the pension by a \"coverture fraction \" in \\nwhich the denominator  is the total time the employee has participated in \\nthe retirement plan and the numerator is the time the employee has been \\nmarried during that participation.   Id.  Distributing a pension by t his \\nmethod generally require s expert testimony to establish present value , \\nwhich was lacking here .  See id.   \\nThe other , simpler  optio n is a \"deferred distribution .\"  Under  this \\napproach , the court must have  evidence of the amount of the employee \\'s \\nbenefit assuming \"he retired on the date of the final hearing without any \\nearly retirement penalty. \"  Id.  \"The court then multiplies this dollar \\namount by the percentage to which the other spouse is entitled. \"  Id.  \\nThis results in a fixed dollar amount that is to be deducted and paid to  \\nthe other spouse each time the pension holder receives a pension benefit.  \\nId.; Brock v. Brock , 690 So. 2d 737, 739 (Fla. 5th DCA 1997) . 4 \\n In the instant case, t he record  before the circuit court included all \\nthe information necessary for calculating the marital portion of Mr. \\nCancel \\'s retirement benefits  and ordering a deferred distribution of Ms. \\nCancel \\'s share.  The court  erred in its  conclusion that it could not \\ndistribute the marital interest in the pension, and it abused its discretion \\nby simply leaving the matter for future consideration when Mr. Cancel \\nretires.  \\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment insofar as it failed to \\nequitably divide Mr. Cancel \\'s pension  benefits , and we remand for further \\nproceedings on that issue.   Because this asset was entirely omitted from \\nthe original equitable distribution scheme,  its distribution on remand \\nmay be accomplished without disturbing the  other awards.  \\nAffirmed in part , reversed in part, and remanded.  \\n \\nSLEET, C.J., and LUCAS , J., Concur.  \\n \\n \\nOpinion subject to revision prior publication.

On appeal, the Mother argues that the trial court \\nerred by entering the no contact order and effectivel y awarding exclusive \\nuse and possession of the parties\\' jointly owned home to the Father when 2 there was no pleading or motion that requested such relief.  Because the \\ntrial court improperly awarded relief that neither party pled, we revers e.   \\nI. BACKGROUND  \\nThe Mother and Father, though unmarried, jointly own a home in \\nHillsborough County where they lived with their two minor children.  On \\nSeptember 3, 2023, following a domestic violence incident,1 the Mother \\nunilaterally moved with the children to Ohio.   \\nOn October 3, 2024, the Father filed a verified petition to establish \\npaternity, timesharing, and other relief as well as another motion for \\ntimesharing and a pickup order to return the children to Florida.  The \\nMother filed a counterpetition to determine paternity, timesharing, and \\nchild support.  None of the pleadings mentioned a no  contact order or a \\nrequest for exclusive use and possession of the parties\\' jointly owned \\nhome.   \\nDuring opening statements at the hearing, the Father for the first \\ntime indicated that he would stipulate to a no contact order, even though \\nsuch relief was not included in any of his pleadings.  Then during the \\nMother\\'s testimony, she was asked if she had  a \"desire\" to live in the joint \\nhome again, and she indicated \"no.\"  After the parties\\' testimony, the \\nFather stated that he was seeking to remain in the home and repeated \\nthat he would agree to a no contact order .  Without discussing the terms \\nof the pot ential no contact order, t he trial court asked the Mother if she \\nhad any objections and stated , \"I can\\'t imagine that there would be any \\nobjection to a no contact order ; is that correct?\"  T he Mother responded \\n \\n1 The Mother testified extensively as to her allegations of domestic \\nviolence against the Father that left her \"afraid for [her] life and [the] \\nsafety of [her] and [her] children.\"   3 with a qualified agreement stating, \"[W]ithout any limitation to other \\nremedies correct. \"   \\nThe trial court then heard closing  arguments  from both sides  \\nduring which  the Father made clear that he sought the return of the \\nchildren to Florida and fifty-fifty week -on, week -off timesharing.  He also \\nsought to remain in the joint home, citing the Mother\\'s prior testimony \\nthat she had no desire to live there, and repeated that he agreed to a no \\ncontact order.  The Mother on the other hand argued that the court was \\nwithout jurisdiction to enter a return order  because the parties were \\nnever married and paternity was not established under the relevant \\nstatute.  She further argued that as the natural mother , she had primary \\ncare, custody, and control of the children .  However, the t rial court \\ndetermined that paternity had been established, ordered that the \\nchildren be returned, and then began to discuss timesharing.  \\nWhen t he Mother expressed concerns over her living situation \\nwithout employment in Florida, the trial court explained that  it was \\nordering that the children be returned to Florida but that  it was not \\nforcing her to return  and that because she previously said that she did \\nnot want to live in the joint ly owned  house, she did  not have to.  She \\nimmediately responded : \\nIf my children are being forced to move back to Florida, I am \\ngoing to live with my children.  I am not going to leave them.  \\nI will not live separately from them.  I would like to live in my \\nhome with my children if my children are going to have to \\nmove b ack to Florida.  \\nThus, despite her initial testimony to the contrary, once she heard that \\nthe children were required to return to Florida, she unequivocally \\nexpressed her desire to live in her home with her children.  She explained \\nthat she did not have anyone in Hillsboro ugh County with whom she \\ncould temporarily  stay and asked if the court was awarding the Father 4 sole use and possession of the home without it being  sought in the \\npleadings .  The trial court explained that it was not awarding the home \\nto either party but then pointed to the Mother\\'s initial testimony that she \\ndid not desire to live in the house —ignoring her most recent statement to \\nthe contrary —to then say that the Father could live there if he so chose.   \\nThereafter, while  discussing the exchange of the children, the trial \\ncourt pointed out that the parties agreed to a no contact order so they \\ncould  not directly exchange the children .  The Mother expressed that \\nsuch would be unworkable because there would be an issue if she \\nwanted to go into the home while  the Father was there.   The trial court \\nagain pointed to the Mother\\'s testimony that she did not wish to live \\nthere and stated that \"she can get her own place set up.\"  The parties \\ncontinued to discuss the timesharing logistics , and toward the end of the \\nhearing, the trial court again expressed that it was not awarding the \\nhouse, again pointed to the Mother\\'s testimony, and again said that the \\nFather could live there.   When the Mother asked for clarification on \\nwhether she could go into the home if she wanted to, the trial court \\nresponded:  \\nNo.  She said she doesn\\'t  want to live there.  Why would she \\nwant to go  in the home?  I mean, I\\'m saying there\\'s a no  \\ncontact order.  So why would she -- let\\'s not stir the pot.  Why \\ndoes she want to go into  the home if potentially he\\'s living in \\nthe home and she\\'s accusing him of domestic  violence against \\nher?  Why even cause -- why even do that?  \\nThe court continued to question why she would want to enter the home \\nand concluded by stating : \"I\\'m not making an award of [the home] , and \\nshe shouldn\\'t just be going in there just for the heck of it, no.  Because \\nshe\\'s indifferent and doesn\\'t want to go live there, then there\\'s no reason \\nfor her to go there.\"   5 A few weeks later, the trial court entered the order on appeal which \\nrequired shared parental responsibility with the parents exercising week -\\non, week -off timesharing.  The order also included a \"Joint Stipulated No \\nContact Order\" provision requiring among other things that neither party \\n\"[g]o to or within 500 feet of where the other [p]arty lives.\"  And r egarding \\nthe joint home, the trial court determined  that it was in the best interest s \\nof the children to stay at the home.  It once again noted the Mother\\'s \\ntestimony that she did not want to stay in the home and stated that it \\nwas \"not entering an order as to what parent can stay in the house but \\ncaution[ed] the Mother on returning to the  home that she said she didn\\'t \\nwant to live in.\"   \\nThe Mother filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the \\nFather\\'s motion did not seek exclusive use and possession of the home  or \\na no contact order.  Cf. Hayes v. Norman Harris Serv s., Inc. , 198 So. 3d \\n716, 718 (Fla. 2d DCA 2016) ( \"While counsel for the Hayes could have \\ndone a better job of informing the court that a separate homestead \\nobjection remained, counsel clearly did so in a timely motion for \\nrehearing. \").  The trial court did not  rule on the motion.   \\nII. ANALYSIS  \\nOn appeal, the Mother argues that the trial court erred by entering \\nthe no contact order and effectively awarding exclusive use and \\npossession of the parties\\' jointly owned home to the Father when there \\nwas no pleading or motion that requested such relief.   We agree.   \\nAs an initial matter, we note that even though the trial court\\'s \\norder stated that it was not entering an order as to which  parent could  \\nstay in the house, the order nonetheless has the effect of awarding \\nexclusive  use and sole possession to the Father.  In particular, the order \\n\"caution[ed] the Mother on returning to the home that she said she didn\\'t 6 want to live in.\"  This was despite the fact that the Mother unequivocally \\nstated that she wanted to live in the home with the children.   \\nAdditionally, the no contact order require s that neither party \"[g]o to or \\nwithin 500 feet of where the other [p]arty lives.\"  And as the Father \\ntestified, he lives in the joint home.  Thus, without a provision allowing \\nthe Mother to enter, the no contact order prevents her from doing so.  \\nFurtherm ore, during the hearing, when the Mother sought clarification \\nas to whether  she could go into the home with the no contact order in \\nplace, the trial court explicitly answered \"no.\"  Therefore, we conclude \\nthat d espite the court\\'s statement to the contrary, it effectively awarded \\nthe Father exclusive use and possession of the home by entering the no \\ncontact orde r.  \\n\"It is well settled that an order adjudicating issues not presented by \\nthe pleadings, noticed to the parties, or litigated below denies \\nfundamental due process. \"  Neumann v. Neumann , 857 So. 2d 372, 373 \\n(Fla. 1st DCA 2003) .  Consequently, courts are without authority to \\naward relief not requested by the pleadings and motions of the parties.  \\nDaniels v. Sorriso Dental Studio, LLC , 164 So. 3d 778, 782 (Fla. 2d DCA \\n2015)  (citing Worthington v. Worthington , 123 So.  3d 1189, 1190 -91 (Fla. \\n2d DCA 2013) ); see also Eadie v. Gillis , 363 So. 3d 1115, 1117 (Fla. 5th \\nDCA 2023)  (\"[A] court violates due process when it awards a remedy that \\na party did not seek .\").  Here, the record is clear and the Father does not \\ndispute that neither his petition nor his motion requested the no contact \\norder or exclusive use and possession of the joint ly owned  home.  \\nInstead, the Father argues that the issue was tried by consent.   \\n\"An issue is tried by consent where the parties fail to object to the \\nintroduction of evidence on the issue. \"  Eadie , 363 So. 3d at 1118  \\n(quoting Dep\\'t of Rev enue  v. Vanjaria Enters., Inc. , 675 So. 2d 252, 254 7 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996) ).  In determining whether an issue was tried by \\nconsent, we consider (1) \"whether there was \\'a fair opportunity to defend\\' \\nthe issue\" and (2) \"whether the defending party \\'could have offered \\nadditional evidence \\' if the issue had been included in the operative \\npleading or motion. \"  Id. (quoting Anchor Prop. & Cas. Ins. v. Trif , 322 So. \\n3d 663, 670 (Fla. 4th DCA 2021) ).   \\nThe Father specifically argues that after he announced during \\nopening statements that he would agree to the entry of a no contact \\norder, the Mother had the entire proceeding to argue against such an \\norder and yet when the court asked if she objected to a n o contact order, \\nshe did not do so.  His argument here fails for two reasons.  First, \\nalthough the Father may have mentioned the no contact order during \\nopening statements, there was no issue to defend at that point.  The \\npurpose of the hearing was to dete rmine whether the children were to be \\nreturned and to set up a timesharing schedule if so.  The Mother \\'s stance \\nfrom the beginning of the hearing was that the children should remain \\nwith her in Ohio.  Thus, the Father \\'s mention at the beginning of the \\nhearing that he would agree to a no contact order did not present an \\nissue where the Mother was proceeding as if she would remain in Ohio \\nwith the children.  This is especially so because the terms of such an \\norder were never raised or discussed.  Notably, at the same time the \\nFather first mentioned the no contact order, he also noted that he would \\nbe agreeable to the Mother returning to Florida with the children and \\nstaying in the joint ly owned  home.  Thus, at the beginning of the hearing, \\nthere was no reason for the Mother  to believe that a no contact order, \\nwhich ostensibly would be put in place to protect her as the domestic \\nviolence victim, would ultimately have the effect of keeping her out of her \\nown home.   Therefore, at that point, there was no issue to defend.  In 8 fact, for purposes of trial by consent, the issue did not arise until the end \\nof the hearing when it became clear that the no contact order would have \\nthe effect of awarding the Father exclusive use and possession of the \\nparties\\' joint ly owned  home.  And at that point, it is clear that the Mother \\ndid not have a fair opportunity to defend the issue.   \\nSecond, the Father\\'s argument fails because, despite his claim that \\nthe Mother failed to object to the no contact order, the record is clear \\nthat once she became aware of the effect of the no contact order, and \\ntherefore the issue, she did in fact  object .  To be clear, despite the trial \\ncourt\\'s repeated reliance on the Mother\\'s initial testimony to conclude \\nthat she did not wish to live in the joint ly owned  home, when the trial \\ncourt ruled that the children were to be returned, the Mother responded :  \\nIf my children are being forced to move back to Florida, I  am \\ngoing to live with my children.  I am not going to leave them.  \\nI will not live separately  from them.  I would like to live in my \\nhome with my children if my children are to have  to move \\nback to Florida . \\nThereafter , when the trial court pointed out that the parties agreed to a \\nno contact order and that they could  not directly exchange the children, \\nthe Mother expressed that such would be unworkable because there \\nwould be an issue if she wanted to go into the home and the Father was \\nthere .  Thus, the Mother did not consent to the no contact order.   \\nWe conclude that the trial court erred in entering the no contact \\norder  where it was not included in the pleadings, was not noticed prior to \\nthe hearing, and was not tried by consent.  Accordingly, we reverse and \\nremand for further proceedings .  See Martin v. Lee , 219 So. 3d 1024, \\n1025 (Fla. 1st DCA 2017)  (reversing an order that granted the husband\\'s \\nore tenus  request for a no contact order during the hearing where he did \\nnot request the no contact order in the pleadings).  \\nReversed  and remanded.  9  \\n \\nSMITH , J., Concur s. \\nATKINSON, J., Dissents.  \\n \\n \\nOpinion subject to revision prior to official publication.

In three assignments of error, Whyte argues that his conviction  is not \\nsupported by sufficient evidence and is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, \\nand that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.   For the following reasons, \\nwe affirm the judgment of the trial court.  \\nFactual and Procedural History  \\n{¶2}  On May 7, 2022 , Mikail was shot and killed while sitting in a vehicle \\nparked outside of a Speedway gas station.  Forest Park Police Officer Kyle Bouley \\ntestified that he responded to Speedway around 2:20  a.m.  He observed Mikail’s  father  \\n(“father”) and Mikail’s father ’s girlfriend (“girlfriend”) tending to Mikail  who was in \\nthe backseat of a BMW.  Bouley could not loc ate a pulse and noted that Mikail  was not \\nbreathing.  \\n{¶3}  Girlfriend  testified that she and father  went to Showcase Bar and Grill \\n(“Showcase”) to pick up Mikail at approximately 10 p.m.   While girlfriend  and father  \\nwere having a drink with Mikail, they were informed that M ikail’s brother (“brother”) \\nwas outside arguing with a woman , who was later identified as  codefendant  Jones.  \\nThey went outside and saw the two arguing while Jones was on the phone.  Brother  \\ngot into his car, a gray Nissan, and girlfriend  observed a blue Jeep follow brother .  The \\nJeep followed brother  to the Shell gas station across the street.  Girlfriend,  father , and \\nMikail drove to Shell while the Jeep circled the parking lot.  Mikail got out of the car, \\nbut girlfriend  could not hear what he said.  W hen he returned to the car, father  drove \\nthem t o the Cruise Inn Ba r.  They  parked in front of the bar, ha d a few drinks, and \\nlistened to music.  \\n{¶4}  They left the bar close to 2:00  a.m. and drove to Speedway so father  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n3 could get a soda.  After father  went into the store, girlfriend  bent down to look into her \\npurse, when she heard gunshots.  She jumped out of the car screaming.  Girlfriend  did \\nnot see who shot Mikail.  \\n{¶5}  Father  testified that his son Mikail called him to pick him up at \\nShowcase because brother  had gotten  into an altercation with Jones .  Mikail and \\nbrother  had gone  to Showcase together.  Father  picked up girlfriend  from work and \\nmet his sons at Showcase.  While father  was enjoying a cocktail with Mikail and \\ngirlfriend , the bar owner informed him that brother  was outside arguing with a \\nwoman.  When he went outside and saw the argument , father  told brother  to get in his \\ncar and leave.  Father  noticed a  blue Je ep following brother  to the Shell station and \\ninitially believed the driver was an undercover officer.  Mik ail got into the backseat of \\nfather ’s car, and they went to Cruise Inn Bar and then to Speedway.  \\n{¶6}  As father  was leaving Speedway, he heard gunshots and saw a tall \\nperson with brown skin and braids wearing a black hoodie, jeans, and gym shoes.  \\nFather  testified that he got a clear picture of the shooter’s face and identified Whyte as \\nthe shooter.  On cross -examination, father  admitted that his testimony was the first \\ntime he provided a description of the shooter.  During a police interview, father  told \\nthe officer he “saw a flash of a guy walki ng to the car” wearing a hoodie .  Father  was \\nescorted to the police st ation after the shooting but was too emotionally upset to speak \\nwith the police.  That night, father  was admitted to the hospital with high blood \\npressure and a mental breakdown . \\n{¶7}  A security guard , who was working outside security at Showcase, \\ntestified that he assisted bar security with  remov ing two black men, who he later \\nlearned were brothers  Mikail and brother , from Showcase.  Jones , who  was on the \\nphone, followed the  brothers  out of the bar and continued to yell and scream at brother  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n4 for 15 to 20 minutes.  She was very angry and threatened brother , who got into a Nissan \\nafter a gentleman in a B MW convinced him to leave.  The security guard  noticed a \\nmetallic blue Jeep drive without its lights on and park close to the BMW.  Once the \\nNissan left  Showcase , the Jeep reversed and followed the Nissan to the Shell station \\nacross the street.  The Nissan drove around the parking lot followed by the Jeep.  \\n{¶8}  A second security guard  testified that two men had an altercation with \\na female inside the bar that was moved outside.  The woman came outside and \\ncontinued to aggressively argue with the men.  The second guard , who obtained \\nbrother ’s identification , observed that brother  was “pretty upset.”  The woman was \\nmaking threats and speaking on the phone the entire time.  Eventually, she went to \\nher car.  Brother  got into his car, and father convinced brother  to leave the parking lot.  \\nWhen brother  left, a Jeep pul led out behind him and followed him . \\n{¶9}  Detective Rebecca Davis of the Forest Park Police Department testified \\nthat she took photos of items found during the search at Jones’s home .  Davis \\nidentified a photo of an empty handgun case found under the bed.  Davis also \\nphotographed a long rifle that was found in the home.  Davis testified  that Jones was \\narrested in August 2022 and charged as a codefe ndant.  \\n{¶10}  Jones testified that she was living with her two children  and her fiancé, \\nPhazion Whyte , in May 2022.   Jones testified that she was charged with murder and \\nfelonious assault as an accomplice.  She was present for the shooting, but she was not \\nthe shooter.  Jones admittedly hoped  to receive a lesser sentence in exchange for her \\ntestimony, but no promises had been made to her.  \\n{¶11}  On the night of the murder, Jones had gone  to Showcase to have drink s \\nwith her friend.  The two were exotic dancers who had been booked to dance at a party \\ndown the street at DJ’s Bar and Grill.  While having cocktails in the bar, brother  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n5 approached her and spoke with her.  She told him  that she was in a relat ionship .  When \\nbrother  made additional comments, Jones responded that if he wanted to discuss her \\nfiancé, they could spe ak outside.  Jones testified that brother  was yelling and upset, so \\nthey we nt outside .  He continued to yell and wanted to speak with her fiancé.  They \\nshouted back and forth, and Jones told him he could call Whyte.  Then, brother  was \\nescorted o ff the premises  by security  and continued to yell in the parking lot . \\n{¶12}  At some point, Jones called Whyte via Facetime to tell him about the \\naltercation.  Whyte wanted to see brother , so she flipped her camera so Whyte could \\nsee him.  Jones went back into the bar and was approached by Mikail , who began \\nyelling at her to stop arguing with his brother.  Brother  got into a grey car and went to \\nthe Shell  station .  Jones and her friend  got into her Jeep  and followed him to Shell .  \\nJones’s friend  knew brother , so they followed him  to speak with him.  \\n{¶13}  When they pulled up next to brother , he immediately pulled off a nd \\ncircled the gas station.  Jones  followed him around the gas station and onto the street.  \\nFather , in his  BMW, drove in front of her Jeep  and stopped, and Mikail  exited from \\nthe passenger side of the car.  When Mikail started yelling, Jones left and drove to DJ’s \\nBar and Grill.  As her friend  and she were entering the bar, Whyte called her and asked \\nher to come home.  \\n{¶14}  When Jones  arrived home, Whyte got into the driver’s seat, and they \\ndrove to his friend Darrion’s home.  When they arrived, Darrion was outside of his car \\nwith the car running.  Whyte and Darrion stood in the parking lot talking for almost \\nten minutes.  Then both cars left and drove to Cruise Inn Bar.  They parked toward the \\nback of the bar, and Whyte walked toward the bar.  \\n{¶15}  Whyte returned to the Jeep and sat in the passenger seat.  Whyte told \\nJones  to follow Darrion.  Darrion drove to Speedway, and she pulled into the parking OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n6 lot next to Speedway .  Whyte put his hoodie up, exited from the car, and walked toward \\nSpeedway.  Within two minutes, Jones heard multiple gunshots.  Whyte called her to \\npick him up, and when he entered the car, he told her to “drive straight and calm.”  \\nWhyte instructed her to drive to Winton Woods Park.  As she d rove through the park, \\nWhyte rolled down his window and threw a gun out of the window.  \\n{¶16}  The next morning, they drove to the airport.  Jones did not want to stay \\nin Cincinnati after the shooting, so they went to Florida for ten days.  On the way to \\nthe airport, Whyte took her cell phone and his, broke them, and threw them into the \\nriver.  One of the phones landed on a sidewalk, and one landed in the river.  Within \\ndays of returning home, they broke up, and  Whyte moved in with his mother . \\n{¶17}  In July 2022,  Detective Robb questioned her at her home about the \\nmurder .  A month later, Jones was interviewed by Detectives Carnine and Robb, and \\nJones was not forthcoming during that interview.  In February 2023,  Jones and her \\nattorney met with both detective s at the jail.  Jones told Robb everything that \\nhappened that night, including that Whyte was the shooter.  Jones showed Det ective  \\nRobb where she thought Whyte threw the gun, but the gun was never recovered.  \\n{¶18}  Jones was shown a video of the Cruise Inn Bar parking lot and identified \\nher Jeep and Darrion’s car circling the parking lot.  Jones explained they were \\nsearching for the black BMW, but she did not know that Whyte wanted to kill the man \\nfrom Showcase.  The  video depicted the Jeep parking and Whyte exiting from the \\nvehicle.  Whyte returned to the Jeep, and instructed Jones to follow Darrion’s car.  As \\nthe two cars were leaving the parking lot, the black BMW was visible.  Jones identified \\nWhyte as the sho oter. \\n{¶19}  Forest Park Police Officer Jeff Carnine testified that his role in the \\ninvestigation was to analyze cell phone records.  He explained that he obtains raw cell OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n7 phone data from cell carriers and inputs the data into a program called CellHawk.  The \\nprogram maps the towers that a phone was connected to during calls, texts, and data \\ntransmission.    \\n{¶20}  Carnine obtained Whyte’s data from Verizon and analyzed the data \\nassociated with Whyte’s phone number that ended in 5337.  The subscriber for the \\nphone had the last name of Whyte, and Whyte was an  authorized user of the phone \\nnumber.  On May 7, 2022, between 12:25 a.m. and the time of the homicide, 16 calls \\nwere made between Whyte’s and Jones’s phones.  There was a 25 -minute call that \\nbegan at 12:35 a.m. and ended at 1:00 a.m.  Less than a minute later, a 38 -second call \\nfrom Jones to Whyte, and two minutes later, a call that lasted 139 seconds from Whyte \\nto Jones.  Video from Showcase confirmed that Jones was on her phone at 12:35 a.m.  \\n{¶21}  At 12:41 a.m., Whyte’s phone called Jones’s phone, and the call lasted \\n74 seconds.  A minute and a half later, a 66 -second call was made from Jones to Whyte.  \\nThe next call was from Whyte to Jones at 12:50 a.m., lasting 95 seconds.  Numerous \\ncalls between the two occurred between 1:02 a.m. and 1:21 a.m.  They did not \\ncommunicate for the next hour and three minutes.  At 2:24 a.m., Whyte’s phone called \\nJones’s phone.  Prior to the homicide, Whyte’s phone connected to the two towers \\nclosest t o the home he shar ed with Jones.  At 2:26 a.m. , Whyte’s phone was within a \\nshort distance from Speedway and Cruise Inn Bar.  Mikail was shot at 2:23 a.m., and \\n45 seconds later, Whyte called J ones , and the phone connected to a tower close to \\nSpeedway.  \\n{¶22}  Carmine also analyzed the data related to Jones’s number, ending in \\n7722, that he obtained from T -mobile.  The subscriber was Phazion Whyte.  Jones \\ncalled Whyte 15 times that night.  Jones’s records indicated that she left Showcase, \\ntraveled to her home, a nd then went to Cruise Inn Bar.  Jones’s phone connected to OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n8 the tower closest to Speedway when Whyte called her at 2:24 a.m.  Between 2:04 and \\n2:08 a.m., her phone was in the area of Cruise Inn Bar.  Her phone traveled from \\nCruise Inn Bar to Speedway and was at or near Speedway at 2:23 a.m.  Shortly after \\nthe shoot ing, Jones’s phone and Whyte’s phone were close to Speedway.  Whyte’s \\nphone was less than a mile from Speedway at 2:26 a.m.  \\n{¶23}  On cross -examination, Whyte questioned why Carmine’s map did not \\nshow Jones’s and Whyte’s phones overlapping immediately after the shooting .  \\nCarmine explained that Jones  and Whyte had different cell phone providers that use \\ndifferent towers.  Because their phones would not use the same towers, their phones \\nwould not ov erlap on the  map.  \\n{¶24}  Detective Mike Robb, a detective with the Forest Park Police \\nDepartment, was assigned to in vestigate the homicide .  He responded to Speedway \\nafter the shooting and had patrol secure the video from all of the Speedway cameras.  \\nTwo days after the shooting, Robb received information from two different sources \\nimplicating Whyte.  Robb obtained Whyte’s cell phone records  to determine if he was \\nnear the shooting.  Based on Whyte’s cell phone records, Robb obtained Jones’s cell \\nphone records.  Jones’s records con firmed that Jones was in the crime area that night, \\nand she was in contact with Whyte prior to and directly after the shooting.   \\n{¶25}  In May 2022, Robb went to the home of Jones and Whyte and \\nconducted a trash pull.  Robb found mail confirming that Jones lived at the home.  In \\nJuly 2022, Robb executed a search warrant at the home.  \\n{¶26}  Surveillance cameras led him to a blue Jeep, and Robb also received \\ninformation that Jones drove that blue Jeep.  Robb went to speak with Jones at her \\nhome on July 5, 2022.  Robb learned that Jones was involved in an argument that \\nnight, but she was not fo rthcoming with information.  In August 2022, Robb OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n9 interviewed Jones at the Springdale Police Department, and she was honest about \\ninformation that did not incriminate her.  His final interview with Jones occurred in \\nFebruary 2023.  Robb met with Jones and her attorney at the jail.  During that \\ninterview, she gave helpful information that corroborated the surveillance video and \\ncell phone data Robb had previously obtained.  Jones was unsure of her driving route \\nafter the shooting, but she remembered driving on Lakeshore Drive, which goes \\nthrough Winton Wood s.  The gun was thrown out of the car during the drive on \\nLakeshore, but the area where the gun was thrown was very large.  \\n{¶27}  Robb also listened to jail calls, and two jail calls made by Whyte were \\nadmitted, one from August 19, 2022 , and one from September 19, 2022.  In the first \\ncall, Whyte stated that he wanted a speedy trial because Jones “can’t hold water.”  \\nBased on that call, Robb interviewed Jones, who decided to cooperate with him.  \\nDuring the second call, Whyte expressed his belief that Jones was not cooperating \\nbecause her case had not been severed from his, and that he had to keep her close to \\nhim to prevent her from co operating.  \\n{¶28}  After Robb’s testimony, both parties rested, and the case was submitted \\nto the jury.  The jury found Whyte guilty of all charges and gun specifications.  \\nSufficiency and Manifest Weight  \\n{¶29}  In his first and second assignment s of error, argued together, Whyte  \\ncontends that conviction for murder was not supported by sufficient evidence and w as \\ncontrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.  Specifically, Whyte claims that the \\nState failed to prove that he was the shooter because Jones’s testimony was unreliable, \\nfather ’s in -court identification of Whyte was not credible, Whyte’s cell phone records \\nshow that his phone was not at Speedway at 2:25 a. m., and the state presented no \\nphysical evidence, such as DNA or fingerprints, tying him to the crime.  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n10 {¶30}  In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing \\ncourt must determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable \\nto the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of \\nthe crim e had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  State v. Jenks , 61 Ohio St.3d \\n259 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.  \\n{¶31}  When considering a weight -of-the-evidence claim, we review “‘the \\nentire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the \\ncredibility of the witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the \\nevidence, the [trier of fact] c learly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage \\nof justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.’”  State v. \\nBailey , 2015 -Ohio -2997, ¶ 59 (1st Dist.), quoting State v. Thompkins , 78 Ohio St.3d \\n380 (1997).   \\n{¶32}  The credibility of the witnesses is an issue for the trier of fact to resolve.  \\nSee State v. Issa , 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67 (2001).  We must afford substantial deference \\nto its credibility determinations because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses \\nand is particularly competent to decide whether, and to what extent, to credit the \\ntestimony of pa rticular witnesses.  (Citations omitted.)  See State v. Roland , 2021 -\\nOhio -4077, ¶ 23 (1st Dist.).  A conviction is not against the manifest weight of the \\nevide nce simply because the factfinder believed the prosecution  testimony.  Id. \\n{¶33}  Whyte contends that the State failed to sufficiently or credibly prove \\nthat he was the individual who shot Mikail because Jones’s and father ’s testimony was \\nnot credible, his cell phone records show that his phone was not at Speedway at 2:25  \\na.m., and the State presented no physical evidence tying him to the crime . \\n{¶34}  With respect to the lack of physical evidence, the gun was never \\nrecovered and no fingerprints or DNA evidence could be obtained from the crime OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n11 scene.  However, the State is not required to present physical evidence or recover a \\nweapon to satisfy its burden of proof.  See State v. English , 2020 -Ohio -4682, ¶ 29 (1st \\nDist.).  \\n{¶35}  The testimony of the cell phone expert established that both Jones and \\nWhyte were close to Speedway at the time of the shooting. At 2:26 a.m. , Whyte’s phone \\nwas within a short distance from Speedway and Cruise Inn Bar.  Mikail was shot at \\n2:23 a.m., and 45 seconds later, Whyte called Jones, and the phone connected to a \\ntower close to Speedway.  Whyte argues that his phone data did not show that his \\nphone overlapped with Jones’s phone less than two minutes after the shooting.  Whyte \\nmisstates the testimony o f the expert.  The expert explained that the phones would not \\noverlap because each had a different cell phone provider that used different towers.  \\nAlthough Car nine could not determine the exact location of Whyte’s phone, he testified \\nthat Whyte’s phone connected to the tower close to the crime scene.  \\n{¶36}  Jones admitted her involvement in the shooting and testified that she \\ndrove Whyte to the business next to Speedway , and Whyte got out of the car and \\nwalked to Speedway.  Shortly thereafter, Jones heard multiple gunshots and Whyte \\ncalled her to pick him up.  After being shown video of the Speedway shooting, Jones \\nrecognized and identified Whyte as the shooter.  Father  also testified that Whyte shot \\nhis son.  Although father  acknowledged that he did not provide a description of the \\nshooter until he testified,  father  explained that he was so traumatized by the shooting, \\nhe was admitted to the hospital with a mental breakdown.  In finding Whyte guilty, \\nthe jury found the testimony to be credible.  Because credibility is an issue for the trier \\nof fact to resolve, we can not say that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest \\nmiscarriage of justice.  \\n{¶37}  Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, we cannot OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n12 say that the State presented insufficient evidence to establish that Whyte shot and \\nkilled Mikail.  This is not an exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily \\nagainst the conviction.  \\n{¶38}  We overrule the first and second assignments of error.  \\nIneffective Assistance of Counsel  \\n{¶39}  In his third assignment of error, Whyte asserts that he was denied the \\neffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to procur e the expert testimony \\nof a crime scene reconstructionist to show Whyte was not the shooter.  \\n{¶40}  To prevail on an ineffective -assistance -of-counsel claim, Whyte must \\nshow that trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of \\nreasonableness, and he was prejudiced as a result.  Strickland v. Washington , 466 U.S. \\n668, 687 -688, 693  (1984).  To demonstrate prejudice, Whyte must establish that, but \\nfor counsel’s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result of trial would have \\nbeen different.  See State v. Patton , 2021 -Ohio -295, ¶ 29  (1st Dist.) .  The failure to \\nmake an adequate showing on either prong is fatal to an ineffective -assistance -of-\\ncounsel claim.  See Strickland at 697.  \\n{¶41}  Whyte argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to call a crime scene \\nreconstructionist to present expert testimony.  In general, “the decision not to call an \\nexpert witness does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because that \\ndecision i s solely a matter of trial strategy.”  Patton at ¶ 30.   Any testimony that a \\nreconstructionist would have  provided is purely speculative.   Whyte has not \\ndemonstrate d that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had his \\ncounsel hired such a n expert.  See id.  at ¶ 31.   \\n{¶42}  Accordingly, we overrule the third assignment of error.  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \\n13 Conclusion  \\n{¶43}  Having overruled Whyte ’s assignments of error, we affirm the judgment \\nof the trial court.  \\nJudgment affirm ed. \\nBOCK, P.J., and KINSLEY , J., concur . \\n \\nPlease note:  \\nThe court has recorded its entry on the date of the release of this opinion.  \\n \", \"Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\nClerk's Office, Atlanta, December 18, 2024.\\nI certify that the above is a true extract from the minutes \\nof the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\nWitness my signature and the seal of said court hereto \\naffixed the day and year last above written.\\n , Clerk.\\nCourt of Appeals \\nof the State of Georgia\\nATLANTA, December 18, 2024\\nThe Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order\\nA25I0098.

Also add the information requiredMy name is harry and i live in florida I  need to file an appeal for my case, and I need help putting everything together. I was convicted of first-degree murder in Florida, but I believe the trial was unfair, and I acted in self-defense. The case stems from a property dispute with my neighbor, Robert Harris, over a piece of land we both claimed to own.  What Happened: One night of 04/december/2012, Robert confronted me on the disputed property. He was armed with a crowbar and was acting aggressively. I genuinely feared for my life, so I acted in self-defense. However, during the trial, the prosecution argued that I killed Robert because I wanted to take control of the land.  Key Evidence Used in Trial:  Property ownership documents that the prosecution claimed showed Robert's right to the land. Witness statements from neighbors suggesting prior hostility between Robert and me. Forensic evidence, including the trajectory of the bullet and the lack of defensive wounds on Robert, which the prosecution argued contradicted my self-defense claim. Why I’m Appealing: I believe the trial was flawed, and I’m filing an appeal for these reasons:  Self-Defense Justification: I acted in self-defense under Florida’s \"Stand Your Ground\" law (Florida Statutes 776.012). The court didn’t properly consider my justification. Inadequate Investigation: Law enforcement didn’t conduct a thorough investigation. For example, the crowbar Robert had wasn’t tested for DNA or fingerprints that could have proven he was a threat. Improper Jury Instructions: The jury wasn’t given clear instructions about the \"Stand Your Ground\" law, so they may not have fully understood how it applied to my case. What I Need for the Appeal:  Police Report: This will show what was documented at the scene of the incident. Autopsy Report: To analyze the nature of Robert’s injuries and how they support my self-defense claim. Medical Records: These show my own injuries from the incident, which are consistent with being attacked. Property Deeds: To provide clarity about the ownership dispute that led to the confrontation. Relevant Laws for the Appeal: The judge name is jorge brown Florida Statutes 782.04 (Murder): Defines the elements of first-degree murder. Florida Statutes 776.012 (Stand Your Ground): Explains the right to use deadly force without a duty to retreat when faced with a legitimate threat. I need help preparing my appeal to show that I was defending myself, the investigation was incomplete, and the jury didn’t get the right guidance. This is my last chance to fight for my freedom.\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["AIMessage(content='**IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 11TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR FLORIDA**\\n\\n**HARRY, Appellant**\\n\\n**v.**\\n\\n**STATE OF FLORIDA, Appellee**\\n\\n**APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 11TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR FLORIDA**\\n\\n**CASE NO. [INSERT CASE NUMBER]**\\n\\n**INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nThis appeal arises from the conviction of Appellant, HARRY, for first-degree murder in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit, in and for Florida. The trial court\\'s verdict was based on a flawed trial process, which denied Appellant his right to a fair trial. This appeal seeks to correct the errors committed during the trial and to ensure that justice is served.\\n\\n**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\\n\\nOn December 4, 2012, a confrontation occurred between Appellant, HARRY, and his neighbor, ROBERT HARRIS, over a disputed piece of land. ROBERT HARRIS was armed with a crowbar and was acting aggressively towards Appellant. Fearing for his life, Appellant acted in self-defense, resulting in the death of ROBERT HARRIS.\\n\\n**TRIAL PROCEEDINGS**\\n\\nDuring the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Appellant killed ROBERT HARRIS to take control of the disputed land. However, this theory was not supported by the evidence. The prosecution relied heavily on property ownership documents, witness statements, and forensic evidence, which were misinterpreted or taken out of context.\\n\\n**ISSUES ON APPEAL**\\n\\nAppellant raises the following issues on appeal:\\n\\n1.  **Self-Defense Justification**: The trial court failed to properly consider Appellant\\'s justification under Florida\\'s \"Stand Your Ground\" law (Florida Statutes 776.012).\\n2.  **Inadequate Investigation**: Law enforcement did not conduct a thorough investigation, including failing to test the crowbar for DNA or fingerprints that could have proven ROBERT HARRIS was a threat.\\n3.  **Improper Jury Instructions**: The jury was not given clear instructions about the \"Stand Your Ground\" law, which may have led to a misunderstanding of how it applied to Appellant\\'s case.\\n\\n**EVIDENCE SUPPORTING APPEAL**\\n\\nTo support Appellant\\'s appeal, the following evidence will be presented:\\n\\n1.  **Police Report**: This will show what was documented at the scene of the incident, including the presence of the crowbar and Appellant\\'s injuries.\\n2.  **Autopsy Report**: To analyze the nature of ROBERT HARRIS\\'s injuries and how they support Appellant\\'s self-defense claim.\\n3.  **Medical Records**: These will show Appellant\\'s own injuries from the incident, which are consistent with being attacked.\\n4.  **Property Deeds**: To provide clarity about the ownership dispute that led to the confrontation.\\n\\n**RELEVANT LAWS**\\n\\nThe following laws are relevant to this appeal:\\n\\n1.  **Florida Statutes 782.04 (Murder)**: Defines the elements of first-degree murder.\\n2.  **Florida Statutes 776.012 (Stand Your Ground)**: Explains the right to use deadly force without a duty to retreat when faced with a legitimate threat.\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**\\n\\nAppellant, HARRY, is innocent of the crime of first-degree murder.

The case stems from a property dispute with my neighbor, Robert Harris, over a piece of land we both claimed to own.\n","\n","What Happened:\n","One night of 04/december/2012, Robert confronted me on the disputed property. He was armed with a crowbar and was acting aggressively. I genuinely feared for my life, so I acted in self-defense. However, during the trial, the prosecution argued that I killed Robert because I wanted to take control of the land.\n","\n","Key Evidence Used in Trial:\n","\n","Property ownership documents that the prosecution claimed showed Robert's right to the land.\n","Witness statements from neighbors suggesting prior hostility between Robert and me.\n","Forensic evidence, including the trajectory of the bullet and the lack of defensive wounds on Robert, which the prosecution argued contradicted my self-defense claim.\n","Why I’m Appealing:\n","I believe the trial was flawed, and I’m filing an appeal for these reasons:\n","\n","Self-Defense Justification: I acted in self-defense under Florida’s \"Stand Your Ground\" law (Florida Statutes 776.012). The court didn’t properly consider my justification.\n","Inadequate Investigation: Law enforcement didn’t conduct a thorough investigation. For example, the crowbar Robert had wasn’t tested for DNA or fingerprints that could have proven he was a threat.\n","Improper Jury Instructions: The jury wasn’t given clear instructions about the \"Stand Your Ground\" law, so they may not have fully understood how it applied to my case.\n","What I Need for the Appeal:\n","\n","Police Report: This will show what was documented at the scene of the incident.\n","Autopsy Report: To analyze the nature of Robert’s injuries and how they support my self-defense claim.\n","Medical Records: These show my own injuries from the incident, which are consistent with being attacked.\n","Property Deeds: To provide clarity about the ownership dispute that led to the confrontation.\n","Relevant Laws for the Appeal:\n","The judge name is jorge brown\n","Florida Statutes 782.04 (Murder): Defines the elements of first-degree murder.\n","Florida Statutes 776.012 (Stand Your Ground): Explains the right to use deadly force without a duty to retreat when faced with a legitimate threat.\n","I need help preparing my appeal to show that I was defending myself, the investigation was incomplete, and the jury didn’t get the right guidance. This is my last chance to fight for my freedom.\"''"],"metadata":{"id":"nB8WuOn4fCF9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install reportlab"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FBbRgrq0ga88","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1734590514448,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":5693,"user":{"displayName":"M.Mehtab Kabir","userId":"09622025594600783505"}},"outputId":"907f0100-531e-4941-e4cf-aea4f5c21a44"},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting reportlab\n","  Downloading reportlab-4.2.5-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (1.5 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pillow>=9.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from reportlab) (11.0.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: chardet in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from reportlab) (5.2.0)\n","Downloading reportlab-4.2.5-py3-none-any.whl (1.9 MB)\n","\u001b[?25l   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/1.9 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[91m━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[90m╺\u001b[0m\u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.2/1.9 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[90m╺\u001b[0m\u001b[90m━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.9/1.9 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m26.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.9/1.9 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m20.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: reportlab\n","Successfully installed reportlab-4.2.5\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter\n","from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\n","\n","\n","# Step 1: Example raw input string with formatting instructions\n","raw_text = str(ai_msg)\n","\n","# Step 2: Function to handle text with formatting instructions and generate a PDF\n","def text_to_formatted_pdf(text, output_file=\"formatted_appeal_case.pdf\"):\n","    c = canvas.Canvas(output_file, pagesize=letter)\n","    width, height = letter\n","    y = height - 40  # Starting y-coordinate\n","    line_height = 15\n","\n","    # Split the text into lines\n","    lines = text.split(\"\\\\n\")\n","\n","    for line in lines:\n","        if \"**\" in line:  # Check for bold text instructions\n","            # Strip the ** and write the text in bold\n","            line = line.replace(\"**\", \"\").strip()\n","            c.setFont(\"Helvetica-Bold\", 12)\n","        else:\n","            # Write regular text\n","            c.setFont(\"Helvetica\", 10)\n","\n","        if y < 40:  # Create a new page if out of space\n","            c.showPage()\n","            y = height - 40\n","\n","        c.drawString(40, y, line.strip())\n","        y -= line_height  # Move to the next line\n","\n","    c.save()\n","    print(f\"Formatted PDF saved as: {output_file}\")\n","\n","\n","# Step 3: Call the function to generate the formatted PDF\n","text_to_formatted_pdf(raw_text, \"formatted_appeal_case.pdf\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QWmavplPJ9V-","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1734591104007,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":320,"user":{"displayName":"M.Mehtab Kabir","userId":"09622025594600783505"}},"outputId":"302577a8-42a7-45d4-8062-30686e286616"},"execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Formatted PDF saved as: formatted_appeal_case.pdf\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"B01WLCnKUWA6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
